<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] When a win is detected, outline the winning cells in like a bubble (CSS)
- [ ] When a loss is detected, make some sort of CSS animation, like fade to "failure" page, "retry?"
- [x] Allow computer to make random first move
- [ ] BUG - when computer makes last move, which is a winning move, then the game still reports a draw, because i think it is checking length of no more moves and determining a win
- [x] BUG - User is able to click computers most recent move and change the cellState
- [ ] Check boxes for picking whos turn
- [ ] Create an about section which explains the mini max algorithm
- [ ] use grid to format app layout
    - [ ] Nested Feature
